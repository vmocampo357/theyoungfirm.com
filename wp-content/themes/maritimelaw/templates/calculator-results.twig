This does not necessarily mean you donâ€™t have a valuable claim.  All it means is that you can expect the company to throw the usual defenses at you while you move forward trying to collect a fair settlement.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Moving forward with your claim will likely be a smart move on your part.  While the company may try to challenge some of your claim, other parts are probably well in your favor.  You probably have a lot of money at stake, so be careful moving forward to handle everything properly. </p>

A lot is at stake for you, and there are definitely right and wrong ways to handle things to make your future better.   Speak to an attorney as soon as you can.</p>

        <p>Remember that the above points are really only basic guidelines and may not apply to your specific situation. Hopefully the answers got you thinking about your claim and how to best protect yourself moving forward. And with many of the answers above, even if you scored low on the questions, there may be ways to minimize or avoid the challenges to your claim.</p>
